# Installation guide
### 1. Clone the repo

  - In your terminal window, run: `git clone https://github.com/tshaddix18/HeatCode`

  - Navigate to the repo: `cd HeatCode`

  - Install required dependencies: `npm`, `python`, `pip`, Docker, DockerDesktop

### 2. Run the front end

  - Navigate to `heat-code` which contains the site code: `cd heat-code`

  - Start node: `npm start`

  - (NOTE: You may need to run `npm install` if you are missing packages)

### 3. Run the back end

  - Install more required dependencies: `pip install python-dotenv`

  - In another terminal window or tab, run `npm run-script start-api`

  - This will run the flask server and enable backend functionality

### 4. Open browser

  - After the servers are running, you should be able to view the site in `localhost:3000` if running locally! 

  - If you're having trouble running it, feel free to reach out or open an issue :)

## Available Scripts and more information
All the website code lives in `heat-code`. 
In the repo directory, you can run:

### `cd heat-code`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
